In the first row, all three figures are symmetrical, and the direction of the axis of symmetry rotates clockwise in sequence. The second row follows the same rule as the first row, and the third row should also satisfy this rule. Only option C is in accord with this.

This suggests a counting sequence 0-1-2 from left to right.\nStep 4) Checking the second row reveals the same counting pattern: the left image shows zero smudges, the middle shows one, and the right shows two.\nStep 5) Therefore, in the third row the middle cell must contain exactly one small smudge, matching the pattern of 0-1-2 in that row.\nStep 6) Among the answer choices, only option B displays a single tiny blemish while the others have none or several, so option B is selected.", "corrupted_answer": "B", "corrupted_wrong_step_index": 3, "step_options": ["Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3", "Step 4", "Step 5", "Step 6", "None of the steps are incorrect"], "correct_step_label": "Step 3", "corruption_type": "focus_on_noise"}
