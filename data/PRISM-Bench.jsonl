B. C. D.", "answer": "B", "solution": "Solution 1: The graphic elements are the same, but there's no clear regularity to the placement. Upon further observation, we find that every row of the nine-grid contains three images that are all symmetrical along an axis. Hence, the question mark should be filled with a symmetric image. But we can't pinpoint a unique answer, so we consider detailing the symmetry axis. Further observation shows that each row's three images have either one horizontal symmetry axis, one vertical symmetry axis, or two perpendicular symmetry axes, as shown below. Thus, the question mark should be filled with an image that has only one horizontal symmetry axis. Only option B satisfies this. So, the correct answer is B. \n\nSolution 2: The graphic elements are the same and we prioritize positional regularity. We first observe horizontally in the nine-grid and through adjacent comparison find that between two adjacent images in the first row, there are exactly two lines that have changed position. We verify this pattern in the second row, and by following it for the third row, the question mark should be an option that \"has exactly two lines that have changed position\" from the previous image, eliminating options A and C. When we can't choose a unique answer by observing the rows, we consider looking columns, we observe again and find that each column also satisfies that there are exactly two lines that have changed position between two adjacent images. This is confirmed in the second column, so among options B and D, only D satisfies that it has exactly two lines that have changed position with the second image in the third column. Thus, the correct answer is D.\n\nSolution 3: The graphic elements are the same, but there's no clear positional regularity. Each square in the nine-grid can be divided into 2x2 smaller squares, and each smaller square has one diagonal line.

Hence, a figure should be placed in the \"?\", which should be formed by moving the small white block at the top end of the first column of the fourth figure to the fifth column (there are only four columns because the first column does not exist after the top white block move), resulting in A.\n\nExplanation two: The elements are the same, all made up of 10 small white blocks, considering their positional patterns.

Hence, for \"?\", a figure should be placed, which is formed by moving the small white block at the top end of the first column of the fourth figure to the second column, thus C.\n\nChalk tends to give the answer to A. Although both arguments can lead to answers, the problem is that the white blocks are all in four columns, and the small white block at the top end of the first column moves to the next column in each figure.

Cypress B. Say C. Star D. Xi", "answer": "A", "solution": "Analysis One: The images are made up of Chinese characters, and it is observed that each line of characters share some common parts, suggesting a pattern to be explored. All characters in the first line have a \"horizontal stroke\", all characters in the second line have a \"dot\", and all characters in the third line have the radical \"冂\", but no clear answer emerges. Upon further observation, a common element can be found in the third line of characters - the \"vertical stroke\", requiring the vertical lines' lengths to be equal (the vertical stroke in the middle of the character \"巾\" and the one on its left side have the same length). Therefore, the question mark should be filled in with a vertical stroke of the same length, thus choosing option A. Hence, the correct answer is A.\n\nAnalysis Two: Observing the graphic characteristics, elements are diverse and attributes have no clear pattern, suggesting a numerical regularity. The figures in the topic have clearly discernible holes, so the number of surfaces is prioritized. Upon observation, the sum of surface numbers for the first row is 2, and for the second row, it's 3, therefore, the sum of surface numbers for the third line should be 4. Ergo, a figure with a surface quantity of 3 should replace the \"?\". Option A has two surfaces, B has one, C has two, and D has three. Thus, the correct answer is D.\n\nNote: There is controversy over this question, as both analyses have points of imprecision. However, after research by the Chalk Teaching team, the preference is for Analysis One. From the perspective of graphic characteristics, such as the second line of characters having a dot while the others don't, and the third line all having the \"冂\" radical, likewise absent in other lines, it's more likely that the test setter wished to set a question point where characters share common elements. For Analysis Two, there are two drawbacks: one is that the arithmetic operation of each row of the sudoku does not create an arithmetic sequence, which isn't rigorous and more tests constancy. Secondly, looking at recent exam questions concerning Chinese characters, the regularity of character-related questions is usually more evident and rigorous. This question lacks that conspicuity.
